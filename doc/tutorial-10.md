# Tutorial 10 - Introducing Ajax

In the [latest tutorial][1] we were happy enough with the results we
achieved in terms of [separation of concerns][2], functional programming
style and elimination of any direct use of CLJS/JS interop.

As we said in [Tutorial 4][3], the very first reason why JS adoption
became so intense had to do with its ability to easily support
client-side validation of HTML forms. This is the same thing we did
from [Tutorial 4][3] to [Tutorial 9][1].

Then, thanks to the introduction of [XmlHttpRequest][4] JS object and
the wide spread of gmail and google maps, the terms **ajax** and **web
2.0** became the most used web buzzwords all over the place and in a
very short time too.

## Preamble

If you want to start working from the end of the [previous tutorial][1],
assuming you've [git][30] installed, do as follows.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs.git
cd modern-cljs
git checkout tutorial-09
git checkout -b tutorial-10-step-1
```

# Introduction

Ajax is not something magic, it's just a kind of client-server
communication, eventually asynchronous, mainly using http/https
protocols. Ajax exploits more [web techniques][5]:

* HTML and CSS for presentation
* DOM for dynamic display and interaction with data
* XML/JSON for the data representation
* XMLHttpRequest object for asynchronous communication
* JavaScript to bring all the above techniques together

A sequence diagram which visualizes the above techniques interaction
applied to a form page example is shown in the next picture.

![Ajax Diagram][6]

As you can see, when a click event is raised, the corresponding event
handler calls the XHR object and registers a callback function, which
will be later notified with the response. The XHR object creates the
http request and sends it to the web server which selects and calls the
appropriate server side handler (i.e. application logic). The server
side handler then returns the response to the XHR object which parses
the response and notifies the result to the registered callback. The
callback function then will manipulate the DOM and/or the CSS of the
page to be shown by the browser to the user.

# No Ajax, no party

If CLJS did not have a way to implement ajax interaction model, it would
be dead before it was born. As usual, CLJS could exploit Google Closure
Library which includes the `goog.net` package to abstract the plain
`XmlHttpRequest` object for supporting ajax communications with a server
from a web browser.

That said, directly interacting with `XmlHttpRequest` or with
`goog.net.XhrIo` and `goog.net.XhrManager` objects could easily become an
hard work to be done. Let's see if CLJS community has done something to
alleviate a sure PITA.

# Introducing shoreleave

After a brief github search, my collegues [Federico Boniardi][7] and
[Francesco Agozzino][8] found the [shoreleave-remote][9] and
[shoreleave-remote-ring][10] libraries.  They appreared immediately to be
really promising in helping our ajax experiments, as compared with
[fetch][11] library, which was the one I was aware of and that depends
on [noir][12] that has been recently [deprecated][13].

As you can read from its [readme][14], Shoreleave is a collection of
integrated libraries that focuses on

* Security
* Idiomatic interfaces
* Common client-side strategies
* HTML5 capabilities
* ClojureScript's advantages

and it builds upon efforts found in other ClojureScript projects, such
as [fetch][11] and [ClojureScriptOne][15] which is like saying that it stands
on the shoulders of giants.

## KISS (Keep It Small and Stupid)

To keep things simple enough we're going to stay with our boring
[shopping calculator][20] form as a reference case to be implemented by using
`shoreleave`.

What we'd like to do is to move the calculation from the client side code
(i.e. CLJS) to the server side code (i.e. CLJ) and then let the former
ask the latter to produce the result to be then manipulated by CLJS.

The following sequence diagram visualizes our requirements.

![Shopping Ajax][16]

The first thing we want to do is to implement the remote function to
calculate the total.

## The server side

Thanks to [Chas Emerick][17], who is one of the most active and
fruitful clojurists, we can exploit [shoreleave-remote-ring][10] by
defining a remote calculate function which will return back the result
(i.e. `total`) from the passed input (i.e. `quantity`, `price`, `tax`
and `discount`).

### Update dependencies

As usual we should first add the `shoreleave-remote-ring` library to
`project.clj`. That said, the current `shoreleave-remote-ring "0.3.0"`
release depends on the `"0.7.0"` release of the
`org.clojure/tools.reader` which is not compatible with the newest
CLJS releases. To overcome this issue I upgraded all the `shoreleave`
libs used in the `modern-cljs` series. So, instead of adding the
canonical `shoreleave` libs you have to had the following not
canonical ones.

```clj
(defproject ...
  ...
  :dependencies [...
                 [org.clojars.magomimmo/shoreleave-remote-ring "0.3.1-SNAPSHOT"]
                 [org.clojars.magomimmo/shoreleave-remote "0.3.1-SNAPSHOT"]]
  ...)
```

> NOTE 1: We also added  the `shoreleave-remote` library to the
> dependencies of the project. This lib will be used later for the
> client-side code.

### defremote

The next step is to define the remote function that implements the
calculation from the `quantity`, `price`, `tax` and `discount` input. The
`shoreleave-remote-ring` library offers the `defremote` macro which is
just like `defn` macro plus includes the registration of the defining function
in a registry implemented as a reference type map (i.e. `(def remotes
(atom {}))`).

Create a new CLJ file named `remotes.clj` in the `src/clj/modern_cljs`
directory and write the following code:

```clojure
(ns modern-cljs.remotes
  (:require [shoreleave.middleware.rpc :refer [defremote]]))

(defremote calculate [quantity price tax discount]
  (-> (* quantity price)
      (* (+ 1 (/ tax 100)))
      (- discount)))
```

As you can see we first declared the new `modern-cljs.remotes`
namespace and required the `shoreleave.middleware.rpc` namespace
refering the `defremote` macro.

Then we used the cited `defremote` macro to define the `calculate`
function.

> NOTE 2: If you compare the remote `calculate` function with the one
> originally defined in the `shopping.cljs` client code in the
> [latest tutorial][1], you should note that the call to `.toFixed`
> CLJS function interop has been removed.

> NOTE 3: The namespace declaration now uses the `:require` form with
> the `:refer` specification, which is something that I prefer to both
> the `:use :only` visibility specifications and the `:require :as`
> one.

### Update the handler

When we introduced [Compojure][18] in [Tutorial 3][19] we defined a
handler which used the `site` wrapper to add a set of standard
*ring-middlewares* suitables for a regular web site. Here is the
content of `core.clj`

```clojure
(ns modern-cljs.core
  (:require [compojure.core :refer [defroutes GET]]
            [compojure.route :refer [resources not-found]]
            [compojure.handler :refer [site]]))

;; defroutes macro defines a function that chains individual route
;; functions together. The request map is passed to each function in
;; turn, until a non-nil response is returned.
(defroutes app-routes
  ; to serve document root address
  (GET "/" [] "<p>Hello from compojure</p>")
  ; to server static pages saved in resources/public directory
  (resources "/")
  ; if page is not found
  (not-found "Page non found"))

;; site function create an handler suitable for a standard website,
;; adding a bunch of standard ring middleware to app-route:
(def handler
  (site app-routes))

```

The `shoreleave-remote-ring` library requires that you add the
`wrap-rpc` wrapper to the top level handler in such a way that it will
be ready to receive ajax calls. Open the `remotes.clj` file again and
add both the required namespaces in the `modern-cljs.remotes`
namespace declaration and the definition of the new handler which
wraps the original one with `wrap-rpc`. Here is the complete
`remotes.clj` content.

```clojure
(ns modern-cljs.remotes
  (:require [modern-cljs.core :refer [handler]]
            [compojure.handler :refer [site]]
            [shoreleave.middleware.rpc :refer [defremote wrap-rpc]]))

(defremote calculate [quantity price tax discount]
  (-> (* quantity price)
      (* (+ 1 (/ tax 100)))
      (- discount)))

(def app (-> (var handler)
             (wrap-rpc)
             (site)))
```

> NOTE 4: We required `modern-cljs.core` and `compojure.handler`
> namespaces to refer `handler` and `site` symbols and we added
> `wrap-rpc` to the `:refer` specification of the already required
> `shoreleave.middleware.rpc` namespace.

The last thing to be done on the server-side is to update the `:ring`
task configuration in the `project.clj` by replacing the
`modern-cljs.core/handler` handler with the new one (i.e. `app`).

```clj
(defproject ...
    ...
    :ring {:handler modern-cljs.remotes/app}
	...)
```

Great: the server-side is done. We now have to fix the client side code,
which means the `shopping.cljs` file.

## The client side

Open the `shopping.cljs` file from the [latest tutorial][1].

```clojure
(ns modern-cljs.shopping
  (:require-macros [hiccups.core :as h])
  (:require [domina :as dom]
            [hiccups.runtime :as hiccupsrt]
            [domina.events :as ev]))

(defn calculate []
  (let [quantity (dom/value (dom/by-id "quantity"))
        price (dom/value (dom/by-id "price"))
        tax (dom/value (dom/by-id "tax"))
        discount (dom/value (dom/by-id "discount"))]
    (dom/set-value! (dom/by-id "total") (-> (* quantity price)
                                            (* (+ 1 (/ tax 100)))
                                            (- discount)
                                            (.toFixed 2)))))
;;; rest of the code
```

First you need to update the namespace declaration by requiring the
`shoreleave.remotes.http-rpc` namespace to refer to `remote-callback`.

```clojure
(ns modern-cljs.shopping
  (:require-macros [hiccups.core :as h])
  (:require [domina :as dom]
            [hiccups.runtime :as hiccupsrt]
            [domina.events :as ev]
            [shoreleave.remotes.http-rpc :refer [remote-callback]]
            [cljs.reader :refer [read-string]]))
```

> NOTE 5: We also added `cljs.reader` namespace to refer to
> `read-string`. The reason will became clear when we'll fix the
> client-side `calculate` function.

Let's now finish the work by modifying the `calculate` function.

```clojure
(defn calculate []
  (let [quantity (read-string (dom/value (dom/by-id "quantity")))
        price (read-string (dom/value (dom/by-id "price")))
        tax (read-string (dom/value (dom/by-id "tax")))
        discount (read-string (dom/value (dom/by-id "discount")))]
    (remote-callback :calculate
                     [quantity price tax discount]
                     #(dom/set-value! (dom/by-id "total") (.toFixed % 2)))))
```

### The arithmetic is not always the same

First take a look at the `let` form. We wrapped the reading of all the
input field values inside a `read-string` form, which returns the JS
object coded in the passed string. That's because CLJS has the same
arithmetic semantics as JS, which is different from the corresponding
one of the CLJ on the JVM. Try to launch the rhino repl from
`modern-cljs` home directory and then evaluate a multiplication
function by passing it two stringified numbers:

```clojure
lein trampoline cljsbuild repl-rhino
Running Rhino-based ClojureScript REPL.
"Type: " :cljs/quit " to quit"
ClojureScript:cljs.user> (* "6" "7")
42
ClojureScript:cljs.user>
```

As you can see, CLJS implicitly casts strings to numbers when we apply
some arithmetic functions, but not all them. As an example try to add
two stringified numbers and them multiply the result by 2 (stringified
or not its the same).

```clojure
ClojureScript:cljs.user> (+ "1" "2")
"12"
ClojureScript:cljs.user> 1
1
ClojureScript:cljs.user> (* "2" (+ "1" "2"))
24
ClojureScript:cljs.user>
```

So, you have been warned. If you start a computation from a sum of
stringified numbers, you are asking for troubles, because you start
from a string concatenation.

Now try the same thing in a regular CLJ repl:

```clojure
lein repl
nREPL server started on port 53127
REPL-y 0.1.4
Clojure 1.5.1
    Exit: Control+D or (exit) or (quit)
Commands: (user/help)
    Docs: (doc function-name-here)
          (find-doc "part-of-name-here")
  Source: (source function-name-here)
          (user/sourcery function-name-here)
 Javadoc: (javadoc java-object-or-class-here)
Examples from clojuredocs.org: [clojuredocs or cdoc]
          (user/clojuredocs name-here)
          (user/clojuredocs "ns-here" "name-here")
user=> (* "6" "7")
ClassCastException java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.lang.Number  clojure.lang.Numbers.multiply (Numbers.java:146)

user=>
```

As you can see CLJ repl throws the `ClassCastException` because it
can't cast a `String` to a `Number`.

It should be now clear why we added `cljs.reader` namespace to
`modern-cljs.shopping` namespace declaration for refering to the CLJS
`read-string` function.

### The remote callback

Take again a look at the `calculate` definition

```clojure
(defn calculate []
  (let [quantity (read-string (dom/value (dom/by-id "quantity")))
        price (read-string (dom/value (dom/by-id "price")))
        tax (read-string (dom/value (dom/by-id "tax")))
        discount (read-string (dom/value (dom/by-id "discount")))]
    (remote-callback :calculate
                     [quantity price tax discount]
                     #(dom/set-value! (dom/by-id "total") (.toFixed % 2)))))
```

After having read the values from the input fields of the shopping
form, the client `calculate` function calls the `remote-callback` one,
which accepts:

* the keywordized remote function name (i.e. `:calculate`);
* a vector of the arguments to be passed to the remote function
  (i.e. `[quantity price tax discount]`);
* an anonymous function which receives the result (i.e. %) from the
  remote calculation through the `remote-callback` call, then formats
  the result (i.e. `.toFixed`) and finally manipulates the DOM by
  setting the value of the `total` input field (i.e. `set-value!`) to
  the formatted one.

# Play&Pray

Now cross your finger and do as follows:

* clean any previous compilation from `modern-cljs` home directory;
* compile the `dev` build;
* run the ring server.

```bash
cd /path/to/modern-cljs
lein do cljsbuild clean, cljsbuild once, ring server-headless
lein trampoline cljsbuild repl-listen # optional - in a new terminal
```

> NOTE 6: As you can see above, we started using the `do` chaining
> feature of the `lein` command to minimize a little bit our typing.

Now visit [shopping-dbg.html][20], click the `Calculate` button and
verify that the shopping calculator returns the expected `total`
value.

Congratulation! You implemented a very simple, yet pretty
representative ajax web application, by using CLJS on the client-side
and CLJ on the server-side.

# Make you a favor

> NOTE 7: This paragraph has been written while using a previous
> version of `shoreleave` libs. *Mutatis Mutandis* (e.g. `_shoreleave`
> instead of `_fetch`), everything should be almost the same when
> using the latest available `shoreleave` version.

Let's finally verify our running ajax application by using the browser
development tools. I'm using Google Chrome Canary, but you can choose
whatever browser you want which provide development tools comparable
with the ones available in Google Chrome Canary.

* If you have stopped the running ring server from the previous
  paragraph, just run it again as explained above;
* Open the development tools (i.e. `Tools->Developer->Developer
  Tools`);
* Select the `Network` pane;
* Visit [shopping-dbg.html][20] page or reload it.

Your browser should look like the following image.

![network-01][21]

Click the `Calculator` button. If you focus on the
`Network` pane, you should now see something similar to the following
image.

![network-02][22]

Now click `_fetch` from the `Name/Path` column. If the `Header`
subpane is not alreay selected, select it and scroll until you can see
the `Form Data` area. You should now see the following view which
reports `calculate` as the value of the `remote` key, and `[1 1 0 0]`
as the value of the passed params to it.

![network-03][23]

Now select the `Response` subpane. You should see the returned value
from the remote `calculate` function like in the following image.

![network-04][24]

That's it folks.

If you created a new git branch as suggested in the preamble of this
tutorial, I suggest you to commit the changes as follows

```bash
git commit -am "introducing ajax"
```

# Next step [Tutorial 11: A deeper understanding of Domina Events][25]

In next tutorial we're going to apply what we just learnt and extend its
application to the login form we introduced in [Tutorial 4][3].
